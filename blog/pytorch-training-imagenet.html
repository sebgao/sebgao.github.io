<title>Training ImageNet using PyTorch, step by step</title>

<xmp  theme="journal" style="display:none;">
### Introduction

Nowadays, deep learning gets remarkable result in image classification, sentimental analysis and etc.
There are several deep learning frameworks developing for research or industry engineering. PyTorch is a productive and flexible framework for deep learning, especially for the research purpose. PyTorch provides a variety of pretrained models, including VGG, ResNet series and etc. You must hear about that these models are trained on the ImageNet dataset, more specifically, the ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition) dataset for classification.

The ILSVRC dataset has many versions, being updated from 2012 to 2017 annually. And moreover, this dataset is not meant just for the classification task. Object detection is also a challenge out of classification. But as for us, the ImageNet dataset usually refer to the classification subset of the ILSVRC dataset.
### Data Preparation

You should have a disk with __300G+__ availiable spaces to download and extract the ImageNet. __SSDs__ are recommended because of their faster speed.
