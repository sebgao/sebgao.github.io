## Ziteng Gao 高子腾

Currently I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science Elite Class, Nanjing University.
I'm expected to pursue a master's degree in computer science in Nanjing University from Sep., 2019.

My research interests include __Computer Vision__ and __Deep Learning__, currently focused in __Object Detection__.

And I'm addicted to digital photography and its post-processing.
