## Ziteng Gao 高子腾

Currently I'm first year graduate student (to pursue a M.Sc. degree) in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University ([南京大学计算机科学与技术系](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/)). I work as a member of [MCG](http://mcg.nju.edu.cn/). I received the B.S. degree from Computer Science Elite Class, Nanjing University in June, 2019.


My research interests include __Computer Vision__ and __Deep Learning__.

And I'm addicted to digital photography and its post-processing.
