## Ziteng Gao 高子腾

Currently I'm first year graduate student (to pursue a M.Sc. degree) in [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/), Nanjing University. I work as a member of [MCG](http://mcg.nju.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Limin Wang](https://wanglimin.github.io/). I received the B.S. degree from Computer Science Elite Class, Nanjing University in June, 2019.

My research interests include Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

And I'm addicted to digital photography and its post-processing.

### Research
#### LIP: Local Importance-based Pooling
###### __Ziteng Gao__, Limin Wang, Gangshan Wu
###### in IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.
##### TL;DR: a learnable, simple, generalized but effective pooling method
[[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04156) [[code]](https://github.com/sebgao/LIP) [[bibtex]](./bibtex/ao_2019_ICCV.bibtex)

### Project for Fun
[cTensor](https://github.com/sebgao/cTensor) -- a super lightweight deep learning library based on NumPy in PyTorch fashion, which supports convolutional operators.
